Use this [Realtime Modis Viewer](https://emilydeardorff.github.io/realtime-modis-viewer/) to explore near real-time MODIS taken in the past week. 
Toggle between the true-color, 7-2-1, and 3-6-7 band combinations to see how different features of our landscape look from space.   

For more information on how to interpret different MODIS band combinations, check out the [MODIS Worldview FAQ](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/faq/worldview-snapshots-faq) from the NASA EarthData Blog.
